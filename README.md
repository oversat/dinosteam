dinoSTEAM hackathon

## Inspiration
I was doing an NFT and AI art exhibition and I noticed how much the Kids liked STEAM based NFT art projects. So I wanted to make a tool that was useful to kids and adults to learn about Web3 technology.

## What it does
Dino STEAM is a web-based app that allows students sign up for a free Blocto Wallet and mint a free Dinosaur themed AI Art NFT that includes a STEAM-powered activity. The Dino STEAM website includes 12 dino-themed activities for families, teachers, and student projects. Everything on the site is free of charge to use.

## How we built it
We built Dino STEAM using a combination of original artwork, AI Art prompts, ChatGPT to help style and improve lesson plan ideas, Google Sites to host a free website, Google Domains for a domain name, Emerald City DAO's Touchstone to generate and host our NFT Smart Contract, Blocto wallet to allow students to mint NFTs into their own wallet, and a low of sweat equity.

## Challenges we ran into
This was a challenging build. I had a lot of moving parts and limited time due to some prior commitments this weekend. So I was under a tight turnaround the whole time. I was also not sure how far I could get with the website development so we'll see where I end up.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Generating easy to use lesson plans with ChatGPT is revolutionary. I hope to incorporate additional lesson plan generation features and AI Art generation features in a future version. 

## What we learned
I learned that even though you might have a strong tech stack, putting all the pieces together is such a difficult task!!

## What's next for Dino STEAM Art Adventures
We're going to bring this product to my friends at Atlanta Public Schools! I'll also talk with Alex, manager at Fulton County Arts and Culture about using this tool in programs in Atlanta.
